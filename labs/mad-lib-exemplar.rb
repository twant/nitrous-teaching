puts "There was once a #{subject} teacher named #{name}. She loved #{verb1}, and wanted her students to be able to solve any problem. One day, #{name} encountered a problem she couldn't solve. She heard a strange sound coming from #{place1}. She looked everywhere for the source of the sound. At first, she thought it was coming from the #{noun1}. Then, she thought it was coming from the #{noun2}. She even checked to make sure it wasn't coming from the #{noun3}. After looking everywhere, she sat down on the #{furniture} in her classroom feeling #{adjective1}. Just then, she heard the sound again, and realized it was coming from her pocket! She pulled out the #{noun4} that had been making all the noise! She felt #{feeling}. Finally, she could sit at her desk and get her work done in peace."
